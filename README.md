# Big-Data-101

**What is big data?** 
<br/>
Big data refers to datasets that are so large and complex that they become difficult to process using traditional data processing tools and techniques. These datasets often come from a variety of sources, such as social media, sensors, and transactional data, and may contain a variety of data types, including text, images, and video. Big data has the potential to provide insights and drive innovation, but it also presents a number of challenges, such as how to store, process, and analyze the data efficiently.

**How it is different than Data mining?** 
<br/>
Data mining is a process that involves analyzing large datasets to identify patterns and trends. It is often used to discover hidden insights in data and can be used to make predictions or recommendations.

Big data is a term that is often used in the context of data mining, as it refers to the large datasets that are often mined for insights. However, the term "big data" can also refer more broadly to the challenges and opportunities associated with working with large and complex datasets.

One key difference between big data and data mining is that big data often refers to the raw data itself, while data mining refers to the process of analyzing and extracting insights from that data. Another difference is that big data often involves working with unstructured data, such as text and images, while data mining is more often used with structured data, such as records in a database.

**Main topics in big data:**
<br/>

**1-Data storage:** One of the main challenges of big data is finding ways to store and manage large datasets. This may involve using distributed storage systems, such as **Hadoop** or **NoSQL** databases.
<br/>

**2-Data processing:** Processing and analyzing big data often requires the use of specialized tools and techniques, such as distributed processing frameworks like **MapReduce** or **Apache Spark**.
<br/>

**3-Data visualization:** Visualizing big data can help make it easier to understand and extract insights from the data. There are a variety of tools and techniques for visualizing big data, including dashboards and data visualization software.
<br/>

**4-Machine learning:** Big data often involves the use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data.
<br/>

**5-Privacy and security:** Working with large datasets can raise concerns around privacy and security, as it may be possible to identify individuals from the data. It is important to consider these issues and take appropriate measures to protect the privacy of individuals.
<br/>

**6-Ethical considerations:** Working with big data can raise a number of ethical considerations, such as bias in data and the use of data for unintended purposes. It is important to consider these issues and take steps to ensure that big data is used ethically.
